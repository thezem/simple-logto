## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Added a migration notice for the upcoming package move from `@ouim/simple-logto` to `@ouim/logto-authkit`
- Documented that `@ouim/simple-logto/backend` will become `@ouim/logto-authkit/server`
- Confirmed `@ouim/simple-logto/bundler-config` will move to `@ouim/logto-authkit/bundler-config`
- Confirmed there will be no compatibility shim for the old `/backend` subpath

### Release Notes
- This is the final old-name line before the rename release.
- The planned follow-up release is `@ouim/logto-authkit`.
- Recommended migration mapping:
  - `@ouim/simple-logto` -> `@ouim/logto-authkit`
  - `@ouim/simple-logto/backend` -> `@ouim/logto-authkit/server`
  - `@ouim/simple-logto/bundler-config` -> `@ouim/logto-authkit/bundler-config`

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (single Node 24 job: lint → type-check → test → build)
- GitHub Actions automated npm publish workflow with provenance
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with branch protection rules and release process

### Fixed
- Popup sign-in race condition: removed `window.location.reload()` from all popup completion paths
- Dangling `setTimeout` in popup cleanup (5-minute stale callback)
- `signIn` lacked try/catch — orphaned interval on throw
- `validateLogtoConfig` used `Object.keys` on a `string[]` array
- `verifyNextAuth` returned `success: false` for valid guest sessions
- `MAX_ERROR_COUNT` forced sign-out on transient network errors (now uses exponential backoff)
- JWT audience array support (RFC 7519 compliance)
- Inconsistent issuer URL construction between JWKS fetch and claim verification
- Unstable guest ID on backend requests (was generating a new UUID per request)
- `Math.random()` UUID fallback in backend (dead code removed)
- JWKS cache invalidation on key rotation (retry-once on signature failure)
- JWT payload fields were not validated before use after `jose` decodes them
- `postMessage` origin check did not verify `event.source === popup`
- Guest cookie used raw `document.cookie` without `Secure`/`SameSite` flags

### Security
- All cookie writes (auth + guest) now go through `cookieUtils` with `Secure: true`, `SameSite: Strict`
- Documented XSS/non-`httpOnly` cookie limitation with backend-assisted mitigation example
- Added `buildAuthCookieHeader` backend helper for `HttpOnly` cookie upgrade
- Added CSRF double-submit cookie protection helpers (`src/backend/csrf.ts`)

> Initial tracked release. Previous releases were internal/experimental.

### Added

- `UserCenter` Radix UI-based account dropdown component
- `CallbackPage` handling both redirect and popup callback flows
- `SignInPage` and sign-in initiation helpers
- Backend JWT verification via `jose` and Logto JWKS endpoint with 5-minute cache
- `verifyAuth`, `verifyNextAuth`, `createExpressAuthMiddleware` backend exports
- Bundler config helpers (`getViteConfig`, `getWebpackConfig`, `getNextConfig`)
- Guest mode fingerprint IDs via `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs`
- Three published entrypoints: main, `/backend`, `/bundler-config`

### Fixed
- Moved `vitest` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`
- Replaced stale `@ouim/better-logto-react` package name in bundler config
- React peer dependency range updated to include React 18 (`^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`)
