# Project Guidelines for simple-logto

This repository contains a small monolithic library for simplifying Logto authentication in React apps. It packages both frontend UI/hooks/contexts and backend JWT verification helpers in a single npm module.

## Code Style

- Language: **TypeScript with ES modules** targeting `ES2020`.
- The `tsconfig.json` enables `strict` mode and common safety flags (`noUnusedLocals`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, etc.). Follow these expectations when adding new code.
- Linting is configured via `.eslintrc.json` at the root (TypeScript ESLint + `eslint-plugin-react` + `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`). Run `npm run lint` to check and `npm run lint:fix` for auto-fixes.
- Use the existing source as examples for formatting:
  - `src/*.ts(x)` files show idiomatic exports, functional React components, and `async/await` usage.
  - Keep imports ordered logically (external packages first, then internal paths).
- All new exports must be re‑exported in `src/index.ts` so they become part of the package API.
- Backend helpers live under `src/backend` with CJS/ESM output controlled by the `exports` field in `package.json`.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React components/hooks under `src/` such as `AuthProvider`, `useAuth`, `UserCenter`, `CallbackPage`, etc. UI primitives are in `src/components/ui` and `src/components/utils`.
- **Bundler configuration helpers** exist in `bundler-config.ts` for Vite, Webpack and Next.js.
- **Backend**: JWT verification helpers and middleware live in `src/backend`. This code is shipped as part of the npm package and is independent of React.
- Types are declared in `src/types.ts` and exported through the index file.
- Examples of usage are available in markdown files at the root (`CALLBACK_EXAMPLE.md`, `INFINITE_RENDER_FIX.md`) and in `src/backend/README.md`.

## Build and Test

- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Build** the library with `npm run build` which runs `vite build` and `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly`.
- `npm run clean` removes the `dist` folder.
- During development you can run `npm run dev` to watch TypeScript; the library does not include a runnable demo application.

### Automated Tests

The repository uses **Vitest** with `happy-dom` and `@testing-library/react`. Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test                             # watch mode
npx vitest run                       # single pass (used in CI)
npx vitest run src/useAuth.test.tsx  # run a single file
```

> Coverage: `npm run test:coverage` requires `@vitest/coverage-v8` (not installed by default). Run `npm install --save-dev @vitest/coverage-v8` before using it.

Test setup is in `vitest.setup.ts` (imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers).

**Test files:**

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `src/context.test.tsx` | `AuthProvider` initialization and token refresh |
| `src/useAuth.test.tsx` | `useAuth` hook — state, redirect, middleware |
| `src/callback.test.tsx` | `CallbackPage` redirect and popup flows |
| `src/user-center.test.tsx` | `UserCenter` component rendering and navigation |
| `src/backend/verify-auth.test.ts` | JWT verification, JWKS cache, audience/issuer checks |
| `src/backend/middleware.test.ts` | Express and Next.js middleware — valid/invalid/guest tokens |

**Coverage policy:** All new functionality must be accompanied by unit tests. Backend code (JWT verification, middleware) should target ≥ 80 % statement coverage. PRs that reduce coverage will be flagged in review.

## Project Conventions

- The package is published under the scope `@ouim/simple-logto`.
- Keep `peerDependencies` up‑to‑date (`@logto/react`, `react`, `react-dom`).
- Avoid introducing runtime dependencies that will bloat consumer bundles; most of the frontend is zero‑dependencies apart from UI primitives already used.
- When touching backend code, remember it is used by Node.js and must not rely on DOM APIs.
- Documentation is primarily the root `readme.md` and `src/backend/README.md`—update these when behavior changes.
- Example servers are provided in `src/backend/example-express.js` and other files; they illustrate how middleware is used and can be executed via Node for manual testing.

## Integration Points

- External dependencies include `@logto/react`, `jose` for JWT handling, `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs` for guest mode, and various Radix UI components for the user center.
- Bundler configuration helpers are necessary to support multiple build environments; use `getBundlerConfig` or the pre‑built configs when customizing.
- The backend JWT helpers reach out to a JWKS endpoint; ensure network calls are mocked or stubbed when writing new code.

## Security

- Authentication code deals with JWTs; maintain strict validation and do not disable runtime checks.
- The backend README describes error cases and token sources. Any changes to token parsing must preserve the order: cookie first, then Authorization header.
- No secrets or environment variables are stored in the repo. Users configure `logtoUrl`, `audience`, etc., at runtime.
