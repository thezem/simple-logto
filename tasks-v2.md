# Improvement Tasks v2 — `@ouim/simple-logto`

> Cleaned-up roadmap for making this library production-ready and open-source quality. This version keeps the completed tasks and their implementation notes, removes stale duplication, and separates real release blockers from optional ecosystem work.

---

## Priority Legend

- 🔴 **Critical** — security, packaging, or correctness issues that can break consumers
- 🟠 **High** — real reliability gaps or release/process issues that should be fixed before wider adoption
- 🟡 **Medium** — meaningful DX, docs, or hardening work that improves confidence and maintainability
- 🟢 **Low** — ecosystem polish and optional enhancements

---

## Phase 1 — Critical Packaging & Security Fixes

> These were blocking issues affecting correctness, package quality, or security expectations for consumers.

**Priority: 🔴 Critical**

- [x] **1.1 — Move `vitest` to `devDependencies`** `vitest` was listed under `dependencies`, causing dev tooling to be installed in consumer projects.

  > Removed `vitest` from `dependencies` and added it alongside `@vitest/ui` in `devDependencies`. The `@vitest/ui` sibling entry was already in devDeps, so this is now consistent.

- [x] **1.2 — Fix stale package name in `bundler-config.ts`** `getBundlerConfig()` referenced `@ouim/better-logto-react`, which is no longer the package name.

  > Replaced `@ouim/better-logto-react` with `@ouim/simple-logto` in the `optimizeDeps.include` array inside the `vite` case of `getBundlerConfig()`. The stale name was the only occurrence in the file.

- [x] **1.3 — Fix React peer dependency range to include React 18** The original peer range skipped React 18, which caused unnecessary install warnings for most users.

  > Updated both `react` and `react-dom` peer dependency ranges to include `^18.0.0`. React 18 is currently the dominant version in use, so this was a significant gap causing spurious npm warnings on install.

- [x] **1.4 — Fix JWT audience array support (RFC 7519 compliance)** `verifyTokenClaims` originally treated `aud` as a single string even though JWT allows a string array.

  > Updated the audience check in `verifyTokenClaims` to use `Array.isArray(aud) ? aud.includes(audience) : aud === audience`. Also added explicit `aud?: string | string[]` (and other standard JWT claims) to the `AuthPayload` interface in `types.ts` for proper typing.

- [x] **1.5 — Fix inconsistent issuer construction in `verifyTokenClaims`** JWKS fetch and issuer verification used different URL construction strategies, which could disagree when `logtoUrl` had a path suffix.

  > Replaced `new URL('oidc', logtoUrl).toString()` with `${normalizedLogtoUrl}/oidc` in `verifyTokenClaims`, mirroring the same strip-trailing-slash + append pattern used by `fetchJWKS`. The `new URL` relative resolution would silently replace the last path segment when `logtoUrl` contained a path.

- [x] **1.6 — Fix unstable guest ID on backend requests** The backend generated a new guest UUID when no guest cookie existed, which made guest identity non-persistent across requests.

  > Replaced all three `generateUUID()` fallbacks in `extractGuestTokenFromCookies` with `null`. Guest identity is established on the frontend (which sets the persistent `guest_logto_authtoken` cookie); the backend should only read it. When no cookie exists `guestId` resolves to `undefined` in the auth context, which is the correct "no guest identity yet" signal to callers.

---

## Phase 2 — Bug Fixes: Auth Flow Correctness

> These fixes addressed real behavior bugs in sign-in, callback, and guest flows.

**Priority: 🟠 High**

- [x] **2.1 — Fix popup sign-in race condition and unnecessary reload** Popup completion triggered async refresh work and then immediately reloaded the page, discarding that work.

  > Removed `window.location.reload()` from all three popup-completion paths (postMessage handler, localStorage fallback handler, and popup-closed poll handler). All three were calling `loadUserRef.current(true)` and `window.location.reload()` on the same synchronous tick; the reload navigated away and killed the in-flight async state update, making the `loadUserRef` call dead code. The `POPUP_AUTH_EVENT_DELAY` (500 ms) is sufficient for Logto's React SDK to sync from shared localStorage before `loadUserRef.current(true)` fetches claims. Extended the top-of-file comment block to document this decision and describe when a conditional reload (post-failure) would be appropriate.

- [x] **2.2 — Fix dangling `setTimeout` in popup cleanup** The popup cleanup timeout was not cleared on successful sign-in.

  > Stored the `setTimeout` return value in `let cleanupTimeoutId` (declared before `handleMessage` so the closure can reference it). In the success handler, `clearTimeout(cleanupTimeoutId)` is called first, then the listener removal and interval cancellation are inlined, removing the dependency on calling `cleanupListener()` and avoiding a forward-reference issue. The 5-minute stale callback can no longer fire after a successful auth.

- [x] **2.3 — Fix `signIn` function lacking try/catch** A thrown `logtoSignIn` call could leave popup bookkeeping behind.

  > Added try/catch around both `logtoSignIn` calls (the `isInPopup` redirect path and the `!shouldUsePopup` direct redirect path). Also added a null-check guard immediately after `window.open()`: when the browser blocks the popup, the function now returns early before any interval or listener is created, preventing orphaned cleanup state.

- [x] **2.4 — Add configurable post-callback redirect** `CallbackPage` used a hard-coded redirect to `/`.

  > Added `redirectTo?: string` (with JSDoc) to `CallbackPageProps` and defaulted it to `'/'` in the component signature. The redirect line now uses `window.location.href = redirectTo`. Existing behaviour is unchanged for consumers that don't pass the prop.

- [x] **2.5 — Fix `validateLogtoConfig` using `Object.keys` on an array** `resources` is a `string[]`, so the old implementation was semantically wrong even if it happened to work.

  > Replaced `Object.keys(config.resources).length === 0` with `config.resources.length === 0` in `validateLogtoConfig`. The old form worked coincidentally because `Object.keys` on an array returns numeric index strings, but it is semantically incorrect and would silently break if the type ever became a plain object.

- [x] **2.6 — Fix `verifyNextAuth` returning `success: false` for valid guests** That shape caused guest sessions to look like auth failures to common callers.

  > Both guest paths in `verifyNextAuth` (no-token + `allowGuest`, and verification-error + `allowGuest`) now return `{ success: true, auth: guestContext }`. Callers should distinguish guests via `result.auth.isGuest`. The middleware tests that were asserting the old `success: false` shape were updated to assert `success: true` and include an explanatory comment.

- [x] **2.7 — Fix transient network errors forcing sign-out** The previous `MAX_ERROR_COUNT` behavior could log users out during short outages.

  > Introduced error classification inside the `loadUser` catch block: transient errors (network failures surfaced as `TypeError`, strings like `networkerror`/`timeout`/`econnrefused`, or 5xx status codes in error messages) now follow an exponential-backoff retry path (up to 5 attempts, capped at 32 s) without clearing user state or signing the user out. Definite auth errors (`invalid`, `expired`, `invalid_grant`, etc.) retain the sign-out path. Added `transientErrorCount` and `backoffTimerRef` refs; the backoff timer is cleared on successful fetch, on unmount (new cleanup `useEffect`), and when transitioning to the unauthenticated state. This ensures a brief network outage self-heals without disrupting the user session.

---

## Phase 3 — Security Hardening

> These tasks hardened the package against common auth-library failure modes and misuse.

**Priority: 🟠 High**

- [x] **3.1 — Document XSS/cookie security limitation and provide `httpOnly` guidance** The frontend cannot set `HttpOnly`, so the limitation needed to be explicit.

  > Added a prominent SECURITY NOTICE block to `jwtCookieUtils.saveToken()` in `utils.ts` documenting the XSS limitation, what `Secure` + `SameSite=Strict` do/don't protect, and two concrete mitigations. Added `buildAuthCookieHeader(token, options)` to the backend entrypoint — generates a `Set-Cookie` header with `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` so backends can upgrade the cookie after verifying it. Includes full JSDoc with Express and Next.js `@example` blocks showing the recommended backend-assisted flow.

- [x] **3.2 — Add CSRF protection helpers for backend middleware** Backend auth helpers validated JWTs but did not help consumers protect state-changing routes.

  > Created `src/backend/csrf.ts` (exported from `src/backend/index.ts`) implementing the double-submit cookie pattern with no new dependencies. Exports: `generateCsrfToken()` (uses `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID` / `node:crypto` fallback), `buildCsrfCookieHeader()` (non-HttpOnly by design — JS must read it), `createCsrfMiddleware()` (Express: issues cookie on GET, validates on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE), `verifyCsrfToken()` (Next.js Route Handler helper returning `{ valid, error? }`), and the `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` / `CSRF_HEADER_NAME` constants. The module header documents the full threat model: what CSRF is, how the double-submit pattern blocks it via same-origin policy, and explicit limitations (defence-in-depth only, not a CSP replacement).

- [x] **3.3 — Remove insecure backend UUID fallback** The prior task was to replace a `Math.random()` fallback, but the code path was dead.

  > The `generateUUID()` function was dead code — task 1.6 had already removed all three call sites that used it. Rather than replacing the `Math.random()` body with `crypto.randomUUID()`, the entire dead function was deleted. There is no longer any UUID generation in the backend; guest IDs come exclusively from the frontend cookie set by `guestUtils`.

- [x] **3.4 — Add JWKS cache invalidation on key rotation** A stale 5-minute JWKS cache could create a failure window when keys rotated.

  > Extracted the inner key-lookup + signature verification into a `verifyWithKeys()` helper. `verifyLogtoToken` now catches errors from `verifyWithKeys` and classifies them: if the error message indicates a key/signature problem (kid not found, signature verification failed, no keys), the cache entry is deleted and verification is retried once with a freshly fetched JWKS. Claims errors (wrong audience, expired token, missing scope) are explicitly NOT retried to avoid masking legitimate auth failures.

- [x] **3.5 — Validate JWT payload fields before use** The code previously trusted decoded payload fields without validating required shape.

  > Added `validatePayloadShape(payload: unknown): asserts payload is AuthPayload` — a TypeScript assertion function using manual checks (no `zod` dep). It verifies: `sub` is a non-empty string (required), `iss` is a string if present, `exp`/`nbf` are numbers if present, and `aud` is a `string | string[]` if present. Called inside `verifyWithKeys()` immediately after `jwtVerify()` returns, before any claim is accessed downstream. Avoids `zod` to keep the dep footprint minimal.

- [x] **3.6 — Harden postMessage origin check in popup flow** Same-origin spoofing needed to be blocked in addition to cross-origin messages.

  > Added `if (event.source !== popup) return` as a second guard in `handleMessage`, immediately after the origin check. The `popup` variable is already in closure scope (it's the `window.open()` return value), so no refactoring was needed. Added a block comment explaining both vectors being guarded against (cross-origin and same-origin spoof).

- [x] **3.7 — Make cookie security settings consistent across auth and guest cookies** Guest cookie writes did not go through the same secure path as auth cookies.

  > Replaced all three raw `document.cookie` operations in `guestUtils` with `cookieUtils` calls: `setGuestId` → `cookieUtils.setCookie` (with `secure: true`, `sameSite: 'strict'`, 7-day expiry matching `jwtCookieUtils`), `clearGuestId` → `cookieUtils.removeCookie`, and `getGuestId` → `cookieUtils.getCookie` (handles percent-encoded cookie names correctly). All cookie writes for both auth and guest tokens now flow through the same utility with identical security flags.

---

## Phase 4 — CI/CD & Release Infrastructure

> This phase established baseline release discipline and automated verification.

**Priority: 🟠 High**

- [x] **4.1 — Add GitHub Actions CI workflow** Run lint, type-check, tests, and build on pushes and PRs.

  > Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggered on push/PR to `master` and `rc`. Runs a matrix across Node 18, 20, and 22 with four sequential steps: `npm run lint` → `npx tsc --noEmit` (type-check without emitting) → `npx vitest run` (single-pass tests) → `npm run build`. All steps must pass; GitHub's branch-protection "require status checks" setting can be pointed at this workflow to block merges on failure.

- [x] **4.2 — Add automated publish workflow** Publish only after the full CI gate passes.

  > Created `.github/workflows/publish.yml` triggered on `release: created`. Runs the identical CI gate (lint → type-check → test → build) before publishing, so a broken release can never reach npm. Publishes with `--provenance` (npm's signed-attestation feature, requires `id-token: write` permission) for supply-chain transparency. The npm token must be stored as `NPM_TOKEN` in the repo's GitHub Secrets.

- [x] **4.3 — Add `CHANGELOG.md` and commit convention guidance** Release hygiene should be documented consistently.

  > Created `CHANGELOG.md` starting at v0.1.8 with an `[Unreleased]` section summarising all Phase 1–4 work, and documented Conventional Commits guidance in the contributor docs. The older task note claiming active local hook-based enforcement is no longer accurate for the current repository state, so it has been corrected here. `standard-version`/`semantic-release` remains a future choice — the Keep-a-Changelog format used here is compatible with both.

- [x] **4.4 — Add branch protection rules documentation** The merge policy needed to be stated in repo docs even though enforcement lives in GitHub settings.

  > Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering: local dev setup, running tests, Conventional Commits convention (with scope table and breaking-change syntax), PR process (branch off `rc`, gate commands, squash-merge policy), branch protection tables for both `master` and `rc` (required checks, approval count, force-push disabled), and the full release process (CHANGELOG → version bump → RC merge → GitHub Release triggers publish workflow).

- [x] **4.5 — Fix stale `copilot-instructions.md`** Repo automation docs should match reality.

  > Replaced the stale "no automated tests" note with a full **Automated Tests** section listing all 6 test files with descriptions, the commands to run them (`npm test`, `npx vitest run`, coverage), and the coverage policy. Also corrected the linter section which falsely claimed "No linter configuration is present" — the repo does have `.eslintrc.json`; updated that line to describe it accurately.

---

## Phase 5 — Test Coverage Expansion

> This phase raised confidence enough to refactor and harden behavior without guessing.

**Priority: 🟠 High**

- [x] **5.1 — Fix broken `callback.test.tsx` tests** Restore meaningful coverage of callback flows rather than leaving known-broken tests behind.

  > Fixed the callback mock/setup so the previously broken scenarios now run correctly, covering redirect success, popup success, error paths, and callback cleanup behavior.

- [x] **5.2 — Fix broken navigation test in `user-center.test.tsx`** The navigation test had drifted from the current implementation.

  > Reworked the mock router/setup so the "navigate to page link" assertion is now valid and stable.

- [x] **5.3 — Add tests for popup sign-in flow** Popup auth was one of the most complex pieces of the package and needed explicit coverage.

  > Added a new `Popup Sign-in Flow` describe block (7 tests) to `context.test.tsx`. Tests cover: (1) popup opens with correct URL+features, (2) popup blocked returns early with console.warn, (3) SIGNIN*SUCCESS closes popup and clears listener, (4) SIGNIN_COMPLETE alias also accepted, (5) cross-origin messages rejected, (6) same-origin spoof (wrong source) rejected, (7) 5-minute auto-cleanup removes message listener. The source-check tests use a plain object (not a real `MessageEvent`) since the handler only reads `.origin`, `.source`, and `.data` — no real DOM event needed. The timeout test switches to `vi.useFakeTimers()` \_after* the initial render/`waitFor` to avoid disrupting React's async effect scheduling.

- [x] **5.4 — Add tests for `verifyTokenClaims` edge cases** The backend verifier needed tests for audience and claim-shape edge cases.

  > Added two new outer `describe` blocks to `verify-auth.test.ts`: `verifyTokenClaims — audience array (RFC 7519)` (3 tests: aud-array match, aud-array mismatch, no audience option) and `validatePayloadShape — required field enforcement` (6 tests: missing sub, empty sub, missing iss, non-numeric exp, expired-at-boundary using `vi.useFakeTimers`, and non-string/array aud). Also fixed the root cause of pre-existing test instability: the outer `beforeEach` used `vi.clearAllMocks()` which does NOT flush `mockResolvedValueOnce` queues — replaced with `vi.resetAllMocks()` throughout the file.

- [x] **5.5 — Add tests for JWKS cache invalidation** Replace placeholder tests with real cache-behavior verification.

  > Replaced the placeholder with three real cache tests inside the existing `JWKS Fetching` describe: (1) cache hit — second call within TTL doesn't call `fetch`; (2) cache miss after TTL — `vi.useFakeTimers()` advances clock 5 min+1s, verifying `fetch` is called twice; (3) key-rotation retry — first `jwtVerify` throws `ERR_JWS_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, cache is invalidated, `fetch` is called a second time, and the retry succeeds. Each test uses a unique `logtoUrl` to get a fresh cache entry.

- [x] **5.6 — Add tests for `guestUtils` and `cookieUtils`** Cookie and guest behavior needed direct unit coverage.

  > Created `src/utils.test.ts` (25 tests). Covers `cookieUtils` (set with encoding, get, overwrite, SSR guard, remove), `jwtCookieUtils` (saveToken/getToken/removeToken round-trip), and `guestUtils` (getGuestId, setGuestId with provided ID / fingerprint / UUID fallback, ensureGuestId, clearGuestId, generateGuestId happy path and fallback). FingerprintJS is mocked via `vi.mock()` factory; individual fallback paths are tested via `mockRejectedValueOnce`. Note: `Secure` flag enforcement is a browser-level restriction that happy-dom does not simulate, so that dimension is implicitly tested via the flag being present in the cookie string passed to `document.cookie`.

- [x] **5.7 — Add tests for `bundler-config.ts` exports** Config helpers should be tested as public API.

  > Created `src/bundler-config.test.ts` (17 tests). Verifies `getBundlerConfig('vite')` returns `optimizeDeps.include: ['@logto/react']` and `resolve.alias: { jose: 'jose/dist/node/cjs' }`, that webpack and nextjs configs have `resolve` but NOT `optimizeDeps`, that nextjs and webpack configs produce identical shapes, that no config contains the stale `@ouim/better-logto-react` name, and that the pre-built `viteConfig`/`webpackConfig`/`nextjsConfig` named exports equal their `getBundlerConfig()` counterparts.

- [x] **5.8 — Add integration test for Express middleware** The Express middleware needed an end-to-end test using a real app.

  > Added `src/backend/express.integration.test.ts` using a real Express app plus `supertest`. The suite mounts `createExpressAuthMiddleware()` and covers the requested end-to-end cases: valid auth cookie, expired token rejection, missing-token 401, guest-cookie fallback, and required-scope enforcement. Added `express`/`supertest` and their TypeScript types as devDependencies to support this integration-level coverage without changing the published package surface.

- [x] **5.9 — Add integration test for Next.js route handler** `verifyNextAuth` needed route-level verification without requiring a full Next runtime.

  > Added `src/backend/next-route.integration.test.ts` with a small route-handler harness around `verifyNextAuth()`. The test uses a real `Headers` object and a minimal request adapter rather than the full Next runtime, which avoids adding `next` as a dev dependency while still covering route-level behavior. It verifies the requested scenarios: authenticated JWT session, guest-cookie flow, missing-token 401, and explicit `allowGuest: false` with no token.

- [x] **5.10 — Set minimum coverage thresholds in Vitest config** CI should fail on real coverage regressions.

  > Added `coverage.thresholds` to `vitest.config.ts` with conservative baselines just below the actual Phase-5 coverage numbers (statements 60%, branches 50%, functions 70%, lines 60%). Also installed `@vitest/coverage-v8` as a devDependency (pinned to `^4.0.18` to stay in-sync with `vitest`). The thresholds are intentionally set lower than the aspirational 80%/75% targets because `context.tsx` and `utils.ts` have significant untested code paths (the complex auth-error/retry logic); they should be raised incrementally alongside later tests. A comment in `vitest.config.ts` documents the intention and the final targets.

---

## Phase 6 — API Stability & Developer Experience

> These changes reduced confusion in the public API and removed hidden coupling.

**Priority: 🟡 Medium**

- [x] **6.1 — Change `useAuth` default redirect from `/404` to `/signin`** Unauthenticated users should not hit a 404 by default.

  > Changed `redirectTo || '/404'` to `redirectTo || '/signin'` in the `middleware === 'auth'` branch of `useAuth`. Updated the JSDoc `@param` description to document the new default. Updated the corresponding test in `useAuth.test.tsx` that was asserting `/404` — it now asserts `/signin` and includes a comment explaining the semantic change. No other call sites reference this default.

- [x] **6.2 — Add customization props to `SignInPage`** `SignInPage` needed minimal presentation and error hooks.

  > Added a new public `SignInPageProps` type and wired `SignInPage` to accept `loadingComponent`, `errorComponent`, and `className`. The component now tracks sign-in bootstrap failures with local state instead of fire-and-forget `signIn(undefined, false)`, rendering either a caller-supplied error UI or a default `<div role="alert">Failed to start sign-in. Please try again.</div>` message. Added `src/signin.test.tsx` covering custom loading UI, default error UI, and functional custom error rendering.

- [x] **6.3 — Fix module-level `customNavigateFunction` singleton** Navigation behavior should be provider-scoped, not global mutable module state.

  > Added `src/navigation.tsx` with a provider-scoped navigation context and switched `AuthProvider` to wrap its tree with `NavigationProvider` instead of mutating a module singleton. `useAuth` and `UserCenter` now resolve navigation from the nearest provider, while `utils.navigateTo` remains as the browser fallback. Added coverage proving nested `AuthProvider` instances keep independent `customNavigate` handlers, which closes the cross-instance override bug in micro-frontend and multi-provider test setups.

- [x] **6.4 — Export all public TypeScript types from package entrypoints** Consumers should not need internal import paths for supported types.

  > Root `src/index.ts` now re-exports the previously missing frontend public types: `AuthContextType`, `AuthProviderProps`, and `SignInPageProps`. Also removed the duplicate inline `CallbackPageProps` declaration from `callback.tsx` so the shared `src/types.ts` definition is the single source of truth. The backend entrypoint already re-exported `src/backend/types.ts`; README examples were updated to show the full supported type import surface from both `@ouim/simple-logto` and `@ouim/simple-logto/backend`.

- [x] **6.5 — Add `audience` array support to `VerifyAuthOptions`** Multi-resource APIs need `string | string[]` rather than a single audience string.

  > Updated `VerifyAuthOptions.audience` to `string | string[]` and changed `verifyTokenClaims()` to treat both the expected audiences and token `aud` claim as arrays, succeeding on any intersection. Added tests covering matching and non-matching option-side audience arrays, and updated the backend docs/README examples to document the expanded type.

- [x] **6.6 — Add development warnings for missing required config** Consumers should get fast feedback before they hit runtime auth failures.

  > Added a `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` guarded block at the top of the `validateLogtoConfig` `useEffect` in `AuthProvider`. Emits three distinct `[simple-logto]`-prefixed warnings: one for missing/empty `appId`, one for missing/empty `endpoint`, and one for an empty `resources` array — each with a brief explanation and a link to the relevant Logto docs page. The existing `validateLogtoConfig()` call still runs immediately after and throws for truly invalid configs. Added 4 tests in `context.test.tsx` (`Development Config Warnings` describe block) covering all three warning cases plus the negative case (no resources-warning when resources are present).

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation Overhaul

> These tasks improved the package’s usability as an open-source auth library.

**Priority: 🟡 Medium**

- [x] **7.1 — Verify and keep `CONTRIBUTING.md` current** The file already existed, so the task is to keep it aligned rather than re-add it.

  > `CONTRIBUTING.md` was already present and fully covered the requested scope before this session. Verified here that it includes local setup, test commands, PR workflow, commit conventions, branch-protection notes, and release publishing steps, so the task list was updated to match repository state.

- [x] **7.2 — Add troubleshooting guide to README** Users need common failure modes documented with causes and fixes.

  > Added a dedicated `## Troubleshooting` section to `README.md` covering all requested issues. Each entry now has an explicit cause/fix breakdown focused on the actual integration points in this package: CORS + credentials for backend cookie flows, JWKS endpoint reachability and cache refresh behavior, audience/resource mismatches, popup browser restrictions plus the `/signin` dependency, and common redirect-loop misconfiguration traps around `/callback`, `callbackUrl`, route protection, and custom navigation.

- [x] **7.3 — Document the implicit `/signin` route requirement for popup flow** Popup sign-in depends on a real route existing in the host app.

  > Added an explicit note to the `SignInPage` section in `README.md`: popup sign-in still needs a real `/signin` route that renders `SignInPage`, because the popup window navigates there before it starts the Logto flow. This makes the routing dependency visible where consumers configure sign-in UI.

- [x] **7.4 — Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** This is expected by GitHub community standards and by external contributors.

  > Added a repository-root `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with an equivalent project policy covering expected behavior, unacceptable conduct, scope, enforcement, and private reporting guidance. Kept it concise and GitHub-community-standards-friendly without introducing extra maintenance burden or project-specific process overhead.

- [x] **7.5 — Add JSDoc examples for backend exports** Backend examples should be copy-pasteable and aligned with the real API surface.

  > Verified that the current backend API surface already had example blocks on the main auth helpers (`verifyLogtoToken`, `createExpressAuthMiddleware`, `verifyNextAuth`, `verifyAuth`, `buildAuthCookieHeader`, `createCsrfMiddleware`, `verifyCsrfToken`). Filled the remaining gap by adding `@example` blocks to the exported CSRF helpers `generateCsrfToken()` and `buildCsrfCookieHeader()`. The old task wording was stale: there is no `nextAuthMiddleware` export in the current package, and the Express helper is named `createExpressAuthMiddleware`.

---

## Phase 8 — Release Blockers Still Open

> These are the highest-value remaining tasks before calling the package production-ready for broad external use.

**Priority: 🟠 High**

- [x] **8.1 — Add consumer smoke tests using packed tarballs** Validate the published package the way users consume it, not just the repo source.

  > Create fixture consumers for at least:
  >
  > - Vite React app importing `@ouim/simple-logto`
  > - Node/Express app importing `@ouim/simple-logto/backend`
  > - Build config importing `@ouim/simple-logto/bundler-config` Use `npm pack` in CI, install the tarball into each fixture, and verify install/build/import behavior. This catches broken `exports`, missing files, incorrect type paths, and CJS/ESM packaging regressions.
  >
  > Added a checked-in `smoke-fixtures/` matrix plus `scripts/run-packed-smoke-tests.mjs`, which packs the current build into a tarball, installs that tarball into three isolated fixture apps, and verifies the consumer paths end to end. The Vite fixture runs `tsc` + `vite build` against the root entrypoint, the backend fixture runs `tsc` plus both ESM and CJS runtime imports against `@ouim/simple-logto/backend`, and the bundler fixture does the same for `@ouim/simple-logto/bundler-config`. Wired `npm run test:smoke` into both `ci.yml` and `publish.yml`, and updated the contributor instructions/local gate to include it.

- [x] **8.2 — Add `SECURITY.md` with a vulnerability disclosure policy** This package handles authentication and should provide a private reporting path.

  > Document where vulnerabilities should be reported, whether GitHub Security Advisories are supported, expected disclosure handling, and which versions are supported for security fixes.
  >
  > Added repository-root `SECURITY.md` with a private disclosure policy, supported-version guidance tied to the latest release / current `rc` line, explicit instruction not to file public issues, and two reporting paths: GitHub Security Advisories (when enabled) plus `security@ouim.dev`. Also documented acknowledgement targets, coordinated disclosure expectations, and the package surface covered by the policy.

- [x] **8.3 — Implement proactive token refresh before expiration** Token refresh is still one of the biggest production-readiness gaps.

  > Add a background timer in `AuthProvider` that refreshes the access token shortly before `exp`, avoids duplicate refreshes, clears timers on sign-out/unmount, and is covered by tests for refresh success, refresh failure, and expired refresh-token fallback.
  >
  > Added a provider-level proactive refresh timer in `src/context.tsx` that schedules a forced auth reload 60 seconds before the access token expires, keeping the backend auth cookie aligned with the token actually written to `logto_authtoken`. The timer is cleared on sign-out, unmount, and unauthenticated transitions, and the implementation now guards both against overlapping timer-driven refresh attempts and against tight retry loops when a refresh returns an access token with an unchanged `exp`. Added coverage in `src/context.test.tsx` for access-token-driven scheduling, auth-error refresh failure, the null-access-token fallback that forces logout when the refresh token is effectively expired, and the unchanged-`exp` edge case raised in review.

- [x] **8.4 — Make package scripts cross-platform** NPM scripts should work reliably for contributors on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

  > Replace shell-specific commands such as `rm -rf dist` with a cross-platform tool like `rimraf`, then verify the documented commands in `AGENTS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` still work on Windows and on CI Linux.
  >
  > Replaced the `clean` script in `package.json` from `rm -rf dist` to `rimraf dist` and added `rimraf` as an explicit devDependency so the script no longer depends on POSIX shell semantics. Verified on Windows by running `npm run clean` and `npm run build`; the documented command names in `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` remain accurate because only the underlying implementation changed.

- [x] **8.5 — Add explicit runtime support policy** Production libraries should clearly define supported environments and enforce them where reasonable.

  > Add an `engines` field to `package.json`, document supported Node/React/`@logto/react` ranges in the README, and align CI with the declared support matrix instead of leaving compatibility implicit.
  >
  > Added `engines.node` to `package.json` with an explicit supported Node policy (`^18.18.0 || ^20.0.0 || ^22.0.0`), documented the supported Node/React/`@logto/react` ranges in a new `README.md` runtime-support section, and changed GitHub Actions to verify the package on Node 18/20/22. The publish workflow now runs on Node 22 so release automation also stays within the declared support matrix.

- [x] **8.6 — Add package-content / export audit checks** Public package structure should be validated automatically.

  > Add a CI step that verifies the final tarball contains the expected `dist` files and entrypoints, and that README examples only use supported public imports. This should fail if an export path is removed, renamed, or points at a missing declaration file.
  >
  > Added `scripts/run-package-audit.mjs` plus `npm run test:package`. The audit runs `npm pack --json`, verifies the tarball contains the required published metadata files and every file referenced by `main` / `module` / `types` / `exports`, and scans README code fences for `@ouim/simple-logto` imports so unsupported subpaths fail the build. Wired it into both GitHub Actions workflows after `npm run build`, and updated the local gate docs in `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include the new check.

## Phase 9 — Reliability & Hardening

> These tasks improve behavior under real deployment conditions without expanding the public surface too aggressively.

**Priority: 🟡 Medium**

- [x] **9.1 — Make JWKS cache configurable** The current module-level in-memory cache is reasonable for many apps, but not ideal everywhere.

  > Start with TTL configurability and explicit cache controls. Only add a pluggable cache adapter if a concrete use case justifies the extra API surface. The first step should be small and testable, not a Redis abstraction by default.
  >
  > Added two small, explicit cache controls to `VerifyAuthOptions`: `jwksCacheTtlMs` to override the default 5 minute per-process JWKS TTL and `skipJwksCache` to bypass the cache for a given verifier/middleware instance. Also exported `invalidateJwksCache(logtoUrl)` and `clearJwksCache()` from the backend entrypoint so operators and tests can force a refresh without restarting the process. Added focused verifier tests for custom TTL expiry, cache bypass, and explicit invalidation, and documented the new controls in both backend docs surfaces.

- [x] **9.2 — Review and remove unnecessary reload behavior in `SignInPage`** Forced reloads should be eliminated or documented as an explicit contract.

  > `src/signin.tsx` still reloads the page when the user is already authenticated and the current path is `/`. Confirm whether this is actually needed for Logto state synchronization; if not, remove it. If it is needed, document the exact reason and scope so consumers understand the tradeoff.
  >
  > Removed the `window.location.reload()` branch from `SignInPage` when an already-authenticated user lands on `/`. The reload was unnecessary because auth state synchronization already happens in `AuthProvider` / `useAuth`; the page only needs to redirect to `/` when it is reached from another route. Added a regression test covering the authenticated-at-root case to ensure the component now stays put without a hard refresh.

- [x] **9.3 — Add lifecycle callbacks to `AuthProvider`** Hooks for important auth transitions would improve integration with host apps.

  > Add well-scoped callbacks such as `onTokenRefresh`, `onAuthError`, and `onSignOut`, with clear guarantees around when they fire and what data they receive. Avoid a generic event bus.
  >
  > Added `onTokenRefresh`, `onAuthError`, and `onSignOut` to `AuthProviderProps` with explicit event payload types in `src/types.ts` instead of a generic emitter. `onTokenRefresh` only fires when an already-loaded authenticated session receives a different access token; `onAuthError` reports both transient and definitive auth failures with a `willSignOut` flag; and `onSignOut` fires immediately before the provider initiates local or global sign-out, including the reason (`user`, `auth_error`, `missing_access_token`, `transient_error_limit`). Added focused context tests for refresh and sign-out/error flows and documented the callbacks in the public README.

- [ ] **9.4 — Improve SSR/client boundary documentation and helpers** The package uses client-only guards in several places; consumers need clearer guidance.

  > Document supported SSR patterns, hydration expectations, and router integration examples for React Router and Next.js. Add small helper docs or examples before adding more runtime abstraction.

- [ ] **9.5 — Add bundle-size monitoring in CI** This package ships UI and auth helpers; size regressions should be visible.

  > Add a lightweight size check or comparison job in CI so new dependencies or accidental bundling changes are caught early.

---

## Phase 10 — Authorization & Access Control

> These are useful, but they are feature expansion rather than core production-readiness blockers.

**Priority: 🟢 Low**

- [ ] **10.1 — Add multi-scope authorization helpers** The current API only supports a single `requiredScope`.

  > Provide helpers such as `requireScopes(scopes, { mode: 'all' | 'any' })` without coupling them too tightly to Express or Next-specific middleware.

- [ ] **10.2 — Add role-based access control (RBAC) helpers** Roles are a common follow-on need once token verification is stable.

  > Add helpers like `hasRole` / `requireRole` against Logto role claims, with explicit docs about expected claim shape and tenant configuration assumptions.

- [ ] **10.3 — Add a frontend permission helper** Conditional rendering against auth state should not require every consumer to re-parse permission data manually.

  > Consider a narrow `usePermission` hook only after the exact token/claim source is clear and stable in the frontend auth state.

---

## Phase 11 — Ecosystem & Community Polish

> Nice-to-haves for broader adoption after the release blockers and reliability gaps are handled.

**Priority: 🟢 Low**

- [ ] **11.1 — Add GitHub issue and PR templates** Improve contribution quality and reduce repetitive triage.

  > Add at least a bug report template, feature request template, and pull request template aligned with the repo’s release and testing expectations.

- [ ] **11.2 — Update Vite to a supported major version** The repo should not sit on stale build tooling longer than necessary.

  > Upgrade from Vite 4, run the full CI gate, and verify the generated library output and `bundler-config` helpers still behave correctly.

- [ ] **11.3 — Remove leftover repo artifacts** Source control should not keep irrelevant backup files.

  > Remove `.npmrc.backup` if it is no longer intentionally needed, and tighten `.gitignore` rules for editor or backup artifacts if needed.

- [ ] **11.4 — Add example applications** Real fixture apps improve adoption and reduce ambiguity in docs.

  > Add small examples for at least React + backend verification and Next.js integration. These can later double as smoke-test fixtures.

- [ ] **11.5 — Add migration and integration guides if adoption grows** These are useful once the core package stabilizes.

  > Candidates include migration from raw `@logto/react`, React Router integration, Next.js App Router integration, and guest-mode guidance. Do this after the base API and release process settle.
